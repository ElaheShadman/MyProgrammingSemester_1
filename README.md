# First Semester Programming – Dual Study Informatik

Welcome to my programming coursework repository for the first semester of my dual study program in Informatik. This space documents my weekly tasks, coding exercises, and learning progress as I build foundational skills in Java and software development.

## 📚 What You'll Find

- Week-by-week folders with Java projects and exercises
- Topics include: introduction to Java, loops, conditions, and practical applications
- Clean code structure and meaningful commit history for each task

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning archive and a public showcase of my academic journey. It reflects my growth in programming and helps me stay organized throughout the semester.

Feel free to explore the folders and follow along as I learn!
